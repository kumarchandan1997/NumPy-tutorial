1)What is NumPy?
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

2)Why Use NumPy?

In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

3)Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?

NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

4)Which Language is NumPy written in?

NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.

5)Installation of NumPy

pip install numpy

6)Checking NumPy Version

import numpy as np

print(np.__version__)
