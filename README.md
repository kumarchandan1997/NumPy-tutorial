# 📌 NumPy Basics – Beginner Notes

## 📖 What is NumPy?
**NumPy** is a powerful **Python library** used for working with **arrays** and numerical data.

It also provides functions for:
- 🔢 Linear Algebra  
- 📐 Fourier Transform  
- 🧮 Matrices and Mathematical Operations  

### 🧠 Key Facts
- Created in **2005** by **Travis Oliphant**
- Open-source and free to use
- NumPy stands for **Numerical Python**

---

## ❓ Why Use NumPy?
Python has built-in **lists** that can act like arrays, but they are:
- ❌ Slow for large datasets
- ❌ Not memory efficient

✅ **NumPy is faster, more efficient, and optimized** for numerical operations.

---

## ⚡ Why is NumPy Faster Than Python Lists?
NumPy arrays:
- Are stored in **continuous (contiguous) memory**
- Store **same type of elements**

### Benefits:
- 🚀 Faster execution
- ⚙️ Efficient memory usage
- 🔁 Supports vectorized operations (no loops)

📌 Python lists store elements at different memory locations, which slows down processing.

## 🧑‍💻 Which Language is NumPy Written In?
- NumPy is written **partially in Python**
- Performance-critical parts are written in:
  - **C**
  - **C++**

This provides:
- 🐍 Python simplicity
- ⚡ C-level speed

## 📦 Installation of NumPy
Install NumPy using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy
